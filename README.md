# NoteMerger WebApp Project Outlines

### 1. Tech Stack:
   - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or a framework like React/Vue/Angular)
   - Backend: Python with Flask/Django
   - Database: MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL/MySQL (SQL)

### 2. Features:
   - User Authentication: Allow users to sign up and log in.
   - Upload Functionality: Users can upload their lecture slides (PDF/PowerPoint) and notes.
   - Merge Functionality: Implement a feature to extract and merge notes into the original slides.
   - Download Option: Users can download the merged file.

### 3. Database Schema:
   - Users Table/Collection: Store user information (username, password, etc.)
   - Uploads Table/Collection: Store information about uploaded files (file path, user ID, etc.)
   - Notes Table/Collection: Store notes associated with each file.

### 4. Implementation Steps:
   - Set up the database and create the necessary tables/collections.
   - Build the backend to handle file uploads and database interactions.
   - Create the frontend for uploading files and displaying notes.
   - Implement the merging logic, which can use libraries like PDF.js for PDFs or OpenPyXL for PowerPoint.

### 5. Security Considerations:
   - Validate file types before upload.
   - Use secure authentication methods.
   - Protect against SQL injection and other attacks.
